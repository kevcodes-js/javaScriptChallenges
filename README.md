# javaScriptChallenges

javaScriptChallenges is a personal repository where I solve algorithms, test interviews, 
and interesting problems, you will also find some notes on how to use or implement things, 
for example, mapping, reducing, and more.

## Contributing
Feedback is welcome, I love feedback and learning about different ways to resolve/implement things.
